          Node set is empty. Make sure you have defined your nodes correctly,
          and that you are treating managed nodes accordingly.
          This is why you are most likely seeing only the default vagrant status.

      provisioners:

        Which either means you intend for the node to be of managed node type or
        you simply forgot to include a box specification.
        Consult the 'Usage' section in the README or review the node definition template 
        Under the 'examples' directory
