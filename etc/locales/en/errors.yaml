        <<[x_x]>>
        Vagrant has been instructed to separate dotfile paths
        Invalid VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH environmental variable
        Here's how to fix this error:
        Run:
          - vagrant environment list to view available environments
          - vagrant environment activate {{ environment_name }} (e.g. %{env})
          Posix:
            - export VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH=.vagrant/{{ environment_name }} vagrant %{args}
          Windows:
            - set VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH=.vagrant\\{{ environment_name }} && vagrant %{args}
