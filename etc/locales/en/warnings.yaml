          Using default: %s
        no_active: |-
          You have not activated a vagrant environment.
          Please do so via `vagrant environment activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME`
          To get a listing of available environments, run: `vagrant environment list`

      nodes:
        empty: |-
          Node set is empty. Make sure you have defined your nodes correctly,
          and that you are treating managed nodes accordingly.
          This is why you are most likely seeing only the default vagrant status.
    environment:
      keys:
        missing: |-
          No .keys directory found for your environment %{env}
          You must initialize the %{env} environment with:
          vagrant environment init %{env}
    missing_plugins: |-
      You are missing at least one required vagrant plugin.
      Plugins: 
      %{plugins}
      You can install these by running:
        vagrant project setup

          Skipped processing linked machines for %{machine} --
          Linked machines must be a yaml list object
    provisioners:
      ansible:
        controller:
          skipping: |-
            Because the Ansible provisioner is in 'controller' mode, we
            are skipping ansible provisionment.
            You must call the provision action ensuring the ansible surrogate hostname
            is specified last, as with:
            vagrant provision %{machine} %{surrogate}          
          nodes:
            not_created: |-
              Ansible provisioner is in 'controller' mode and the node %{machine} is not yet created.
              As such, I am skipping the ansible provisionment step.
              Once it has been created, please run the provisionment action manually:
              vagrant provision %{machine}
